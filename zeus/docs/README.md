## Integration with Athena

Zeus is designed to work seamlessly with Athena. The assistants created and configured in Zeus can be directly used in the Athena interface. Ensure that both Zeus and Athena are using consistent API endpoints and data structures for smooth integration.

## Key Components

- **AssistantBuilder**: Main interface for creating and editing assistant configurations
- **ComponentLibrary**: Manages the modular components used to build assistants
- **BuilderService**: Handles API interactions for saving and retrieving assistant configurations
- **BuilderContext**: Manages global state for the builder interface
- **useAssistantConfig**: Custom hook for managing assistant configuration state
